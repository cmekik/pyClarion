## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `SubsystemRealizer` and `AgentRealizer` automatically connect member realizers 
upon insertion (using data present in members' construct symbols) and disconnect
them upon deletion. 
- `BufferRealizer.propagate()` docs now contain a warning about potential unexpected/unwanted behavior.

### Changed

- `Behavior`, `Buffer` and `Response` factories assign `BehaviorID`, 
`BufferID`, and `ResponseID` tuples as construct identifiers.
- `Appraisal` construct renamed `Response` to avoid association with appraisal theory.

### Fixed

- Bug in `SubsystemRealizer` allowing connections between constructs that should not be linked.
- Bug in `ConstantSource` allowing mutation of output activation packets.
