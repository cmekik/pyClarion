# pyClarion Readme

This is a python implementation of the Clarion cognitive architecture. 

To grasp the architecture of this codebase, the recommended reading order is:
    
1. `nodes.py`
2. `activation.py`
3. `action.py`

Other modules may then be read at one's own discretion. It is worth noting that
`examples/raven_matrix.py` combines many of the basic objects defined in the 
above files in order to demonstrate how they may be combined to create 
simulations in the Clarion framework. 

Implementation of larger constructs, such as individual subsystems are 
forthcoming.
