The setting is loosely inspired by the *Wisconsin Card Sorting Task* (WCST), which is used in the assessment of executive function. Familiarity with this task is also not required, it is sufficient to know that the task involves matching cards based on various figural attributes. \n",

Activation of these attributes in the bottom level of the architecture may then drive partial activation of matching chunks.

This is a fairly elementary process that nevertheless illustrates many core features of the library."

Chunks link chunk nodes in the top level of the architecture to collections of (micro)features in the bottom level of the architecture. These (micro)features are, in turn, represented in the form of dimension-value pairs. Links between a chunk node and its (micro)features are defined by a chunk's *top-down weight vector*, which determines how activations propagate from the chunk node to each of its (micro)feature nodes. \n",

    "For a chunk $c$, its bottom-up activation $s_c^{bu}$ is computed as follows, where $w_{ci}$ designates the top-down dimensional weight linking chunk $c$ to features associated with its $i$-th dimension, $x_i$ is the activation of dimension $i$ of chunk $c$ in the bottom level, and $f$ is a superlinear function of some norm of $w$ (in the present implementation $f(w) = 1 + \\sum_i |w_i|$). \n",
